    <p data-q="What is Instagram?">Instagram is a fun and quirky way to share your life with friends through a series of pictures. Snap a photo with your mobile phone, then choose a filter to transform the image into a memory to keep around forever. We're building Instagram to allow
      you to experience moments in your friends' lives through pictures as they happen. We imagine a world more connected through photos.</p>
    <p data-q="How much is your app?">
      $0.00 - available for free in the Apple App Store and Google Play store.
    </p>
    <p data-q="Where does the name come from?">
      When we were kids we loved playing around with cameras. We loved how different types of old cameras marketed themselves as "instant" - something we take for granted today. We also felt that the snapshots people were taking were kind of like telegrams
      in that they got sent over the wire to others - so we figured why not combine the two?
    </p>
    <p data-q="What other services are you compatible with?">
      Currently, you can share your photos on a photo-by-photo basis on Flickr, Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, if you specify a location with your photo, you can opt to have us check you in on Foursquare. Going forward, we plan on supporting additional
      services but have nothing else to announce at this time.
    </p>
    <p data-q="How does privacy work?">
      We have adopted a follower model that means if you're "public" on Instagram, anyone can subscribe to follow your photos. We do, however, have a special private option. In this mode, a user can make sure he/she must approve all follow requests before they
      go through.
